Welcome to the [harrison.ai](https://harrison.ai) Data Engineering Handbook.  This "book" is the canonical source of information for how the Data Engineering team operates and while being used as a source of reference for new and existing team members, it is also intended to be a platform for discussion and collaboration so we can improve the way we do things.  We strive to be both transparent and clear about how we work which is why this document has been made publicly available and is licensed under the [Mozilla Public License](https://github.com/harrison-ai/dataeng-handbook/blob/main/LICENSE).  Suggestions for improvement are welcome via a [pull request](https://github.com/harrison-ai/dataeng-handbook/pulls).
