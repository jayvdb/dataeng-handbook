Summary: How we engineer

The intent of this section is to standardise the way we work from an technical and engineering perspective and contains a variety of different documents from style guides to templates and work processes.  The information in this section is intended to both serve as a means of standardising and making our work more efficient, as well as a way to effective on-board new team members.  If there are aspects of this documentation and processes that need to change we should discuss potential changes and make proposals and requests via a [pull request](https://github.com/harrison-ai/dataeng-handbook/pulls).
