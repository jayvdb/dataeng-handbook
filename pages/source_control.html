<h2 id="introduction"><a class="toclink" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The harrison.ai data engineering team uses <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> for source control management and employs the git flow workflow; if you are not familiar or need a refresher on git flow, this explanation by Atlassian <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow">https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow</a> is a useful reference.</p>
<p><img alt="branches.svg" src="../pages/branches.svg" /></p>
<p>Almost all of our git repositories consist of the following branch types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>main</strong>: is the production release branch that contains the code operating within the production environment.  With the exception of <strong>hotfixes</strong>, code can only reach the <strong>main</strong> branch following a pull request and by merging in from the <strong>develop</strong> or in some circumstances a <strong>release</strong> branch.</li>
<li><strong>develop</strong>: is the deployment branch for the development environment.  The develop branch is used as a means of testing patches and features intended for release into the <strong>main</strong> branch.</li>
<li><strong>feature</strong>: a branch created from <strong>develop</strong> that is used to develop and add new features to the code base.</li>
<li><strong>bugfix</strong>: a branch created from <strong>develop</strong> that is used to implement fixes to reported issues. </li>
<li><strong>hotfix</strong>: hotfix branches created from the <strong>master</strong> branch are used for fixes that must be quickly applied to production code.  Once these branches are merged into master, a merge from <strong>master</strong> into <strong>develop</strong> is also required.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently the data engineering team does not employ a dedicated <strong>release</strong> branch, due to the size of the team working on the code base and the desire for fast feedback cycles with production. </p>
<h2 id="branching-workflow"><a class="toclink" href="#branching-workflow">Branching Workflow</a></h2>
<p>When working on a development task, the first step is to create an appropriate branch within the correct code repository.  To ensure <strong>the newly created branch is up to date</strong> it is recommended that the branch
be created from the interface of the central repository e.e. github.  If you are creating the branch from a local version of the repo, you must <strong>ensure you fetch the latest updates first</strong>.  Whichever method is used, ensure you
are branching from <strong>develop</strong> with the exception of <strong>hotfix</strong> braanches which are created from <strong>main</strong>.</p>
<p>The following naming convention is to be used when creating new branches:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>BRANCH TYPE/TASK REFERENCE</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <strong>BRANCH TYPE</strong> is one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>feature</li>
<li>bugfix</li>
<li>hotfix</li>
</ul>
<p>and the <strong>TASK REFERENCE</strong> is the task or ticket number created from Jira.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>feature/PRO-123</p>
<p>bugfix/FOO-1024</p>
<p>hotfix/BAR-785</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The intent behind this naming convention is that when looking at pull requests or a list of branches for a repository their context can be easily determined by the branch type and more detailed information such as 
the definition of done can be obtained by referring to the corresponding Jira ticket.  This is particularly useful for reviewers of pull requests to ensure the branch meets the requirements of the definition of done.
If setup correctly, Jira will also automatically update the status of the branch within the ticket itself, indicating if a PR (pull request) has been created or even merged.Once you have committed your patch to the branch a pull request is then created, to merge the patch into the original source branch with the name of the branch in the title.</p>
<h2 id="commit-messages"><a class="toclink" href="#commit-messages">Commit Messages</a></h2>
<p>Writing clear and meaningful commit messages are a particularly important part of the development process, as they form both a record of the work that has been completed that can be used for later reference, help in communicating with readers or reviewers of your code as well as help to structure the work itself.  By establishing a common commit message format, reading pull requests and commit logs will become a lot easier and more straight forward.  </p>
<h3 id="anatomy-of-a-git-commit"><a class="toclink" href="#anatomy-of-a-git-commit">Anatomy of a Git Commit</a></h3>
<p>The anatomy of a git commit message used within the data engineering team is as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">type: Sentence case summary (max 50 chars) #JIRA-123

Detailed summary text, wrapped to 72 characters.  **Ensure**
that the blank line between the Sentence case summary
and this detailed summary text is present.
A bullet point list
 - has a hanging ident

 - with a blank line between lines
</code></pre>
<p>The key features of the anatomy above are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The JIRA (or Github) ticket reference.  This is used to ensure the commit is linked to the corresponding ticket and the current status of the task is automatically updated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The type of the commit:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>feat</strong> for a new feature being added in the commit</li>
<li><strong>fix</strong> for a bug fix</li>
<li><strong>refactor</strong> no changes to the functionality have been made, but some aspect of the codebase has been refactored</li>
<li><strong>test</strong> any commits related to testing</li>
<li><strong>docs</strong> any commits that relate to documentation</li>
<li><strong>chore</strong> regular code maintenance e.g. dependency version bumps</li>
<li><strong>revert</strong> undo a previous commit </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sentence case summary, analogous to an email subject line provides the summary of the work done in the commit.  This line is to be no more than 50 characters long and does not end with a fullstop.</p>
</li>
<li>The blank line between the title and the body of the commit message is key for running tools like rebase, however it can be ommitted if the detailed summary text paragraph is not provided.</li>
<li>(Optional) Detailed summary paragraph(s), each beginning with Capitalisation.  This paragraph is intended to explain the changes made within the commit and why they were made.</li>
<li>No whitespace errors</li>
<li>No unnecessary punctuation</li>
<li>Written using Markdown</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the anatomy of the commit, when writing the message itself you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the imperative i.e. use "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug" or "Fixed bug"</li>
<li>Not assume the reader of the commit (or later pull request) has the same knowledge of the original problem being solved, ensure it is described within the message.</li>
<li>Not consider your code to be self-explanatory, context matters. </li>
<li>Use emojis to add some fun 😁🚀</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-commit-messages"><a class="toclink" href="#example-commit-messages">Example Commit Messages</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">feat: Add dicom to json export JIRA-123

Add `dcm_to_json` method to DicomMgr class to simplify
compatibility with downstream microservices.
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">docs: Update installation instructions in README #11 
</code></pre>
<p>While this seems like a lot to think about for a simple commit message, getting into the habit of writing good commit messages will pay dividends later.</p>
<p>💡 <strong>TIP</strong> Tools such as <a href="https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/">commitzen</a> can make creating commit messages a lot easier and in the future this may become a part of our standard toolkit.</p>
<h2 id="pull-requests"><a class="toclink" href="#pull-requests">Pull Requests</a></h2>
<p>As good commit messages help to communicate the additional context as to how and why changes were made to a code base, Pull Requests (PRs) also form an important part of this process.  PRs are a key part of developing quality software as they provide a means of:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensuring the committed code achieves the desired result</li>
<li>checking that additional bugs or security vulnerabilities are not introduced to the code base</li>
<li>assessing the changes for any further increase in maintenance burden</li>
<li>informing and making other design decisions, as well as</li>
<li>ensuring the code adheres to agreed upon standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Combining the above points with the fact that the code review process involves reviewing what could be many hours hard work of one of your colleagues it is critical that effective communication throughout the review process be maintained.  While direct conversation and pair review should be considered the first and most important step in any PR, the standardised structure and process described within this section of the handbook is to be used to assist in asynchronous work environments and align expectations of the required components within a PR.
The PR process can play a significant role in shaping, informing and reflecting the culture of a team and as such they must be completed with the respect they deserve. </p>
<p>When done properly a good PR can lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher quality, more efficient and faster code reviews as authors and reviewers of code a like can better understand the problem, context and the code that was written.</li>
<li>Generating records of design decisions as well as providing input to later project planning stages.</li>
<li>Better quality code through robust discussion, standardised structure, more readable and testable code.</li>
</ul>
<p>💡 <strong>TIP</strong> When submitting a patch for a PR keep in mind that one or more of your colleagues will be investing their time to review your work.  The quality of the submitted patch and PR must be respectful of their time and effort.</p>
<p>💡 <strong>TIP</strong> When reviewing a Pull Request remember that you are reviewing the work of your colleague.  The time and effort invested in the review as well as the comments and suggestions must be respectful of the hard work put into the PR.</p>
<p>💡 <strong>TIP</strong> written review comments are unable to communicate tone.  The reader of a comment may misinterpret the meaning intended by the author based on the text alone.  Be considerate of this fact when writing comments or suggestions and if you feel that a particular statement would benefit from further explanation then it may be worth discussing "in-person" before leaving the comment on a PR.</p>

<pre><code class="language-markdown">## What
I've added a method for exporting DICOM files from the DicomManager

*magic* as per JIRA-123.  Consistent with other functionality within
the class, the [pydicom](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/)
package has been used to execute the JSON conversion as it is the most
mature package for working with DICOM files in Python.  If refer to
line 22 in file `thing.py` you will notice the use of a recursive
function call to assist with DICOM tag conversion as opposed to a
nested for loop.  This was a specific design decision as the DICOM
tags themselves can contain multiple levels of nesting and the
number of levels is variable and unknown.

The API documentation has also been updated to reflect the new feature.

<h2 id="approval-process"><a class="toclink" href="#approval-process">Approval Process</a></h2>
<p>In order to merge a branch into either <em>develop</em> or <em>master</em> a pull request must be approved by at least one, preferably two subject matter experts.  These constraints are to be configured at the repository level to ensure a merge cannot be committed without appropriate approval.  The review process, while checking the code satisfies the requirements of the ticket should also ensure that the code adheres to any relevant style guides, as well as the various formatting described within this page.  When executing the merge the commits should be squashed for readability.</p>
